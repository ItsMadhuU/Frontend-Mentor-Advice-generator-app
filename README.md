## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am doing a course on front-end development. I wanted to test out my Js skills as I go through the course. This particular project had a relatively simple html and css part.
I've come to realize that I still need to practice my Js skills a lot.

### Continued development

I will have to focus on projects that involve DOM manipulation in the future. I need to get comfortable with it. I also plan to do a course on React in the near future. I'll probably get back to this project to improvise it in any way possible in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://javascript.info/) - This helped me out with promises and async Js that I needed to understand to complete this project
